In 2018 as part of its **new brand strategy**, Havana Club made a collaboration with a French artist: **VALD**. The opportunity for the artist to create **his first bottle with his signature design.**

## A unique collaboration:

As part of this new collaboration in 2018, I had the opportunity to work closely with the Digital Manager in the implementation of this project.

I was involved in several operational aspects and in the management of the project:

- Ensure the correct printing of the labels and application on the bottles with the Brand Manager
- Supervision of the shooting of the bottle
- Participation in the implementation of the influence strategy
- Ensure the creation of the landing page for the sale of the bottle
- Participation in the shooting of the media operation with Konbini
