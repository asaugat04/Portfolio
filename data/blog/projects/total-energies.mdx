## Achievements:

To meet the client's expectations, I worked in a **collaborative way** using Microsoft Teams, SharePoint & Adobe Creative Cloud. This work method allowed me to be as **efficient and agile as possible** in order to provide the highest level of satisfaction. I was able to stand out in the speed of execution of the deliverables ordered by the client.
